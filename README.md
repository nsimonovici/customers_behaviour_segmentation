# customers_behaviour_segmentation
Project part of OpenClassrooms Data Scientist path

Our aim is to develop a tool understanding a sales website customers behaviour through unsupervised learning. Then we will build a second tool predicting customers profiles based on the behaviours previously determined.

Steps are as follow :

- Clean data, explore data
- Find customers behaviours through clustering (unsupervised learning)
- Predict new customers behaviours through a classification model (supervised learning)
